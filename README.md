### Cucumber based tests 
   * API is quiet error prone.
   * I have only implemented a few scenarios for the pets , just for an idea.
   
   

### To run the project
* npm install
* npm run cucumber-regression
* test report should open automatically after test run is complete, or else check under cucumber-report folder
